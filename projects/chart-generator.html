			    <p class="modal-text">My team and I were given the responsibility to generate charts using data provided by the company to display on the company website.</p>
			    <p class="modal-text">I decided to create a data form in XML so that even other departments can create their own charts shortening the process of developing a chart manually (which took around an hour).</p>
			    <p class="modal-text">Using the data form that holds the user's input information, I created a general format that is able to generate a chart based on the user's input using the XPath tool extensively which turns the input into pathways which are then put into my JavaScript file to redraw the chart.</p>
			    <img class="project-img-singular" src="../img/bipolar-chart-block.png">
			    <p class="modal-text">The best part was finding a way to rotate the labels to work in Internet Explorer which required the use of JavaScript. After checking that the user was using Internet Explorer, I used the attribute function targetting only the labels to have them rotated at a 45 degree angle.</p>
			    <p class="modal-text">This process now only takes 5 minutes to create a chart by creating the data form and pairing it with the general chart format which can be used by any department with no coding knowledge.</p>
