			    <p class="modal-text">The website was a great learning experience for me to learn more on web design and development that can be shown to employers and colleagues.</p>
			    <p class="modal-text">The plan was to make my website into my own personal portfolio where I could showcase all of my experience, projects, etc. I made a final mockup design using Figma where my portfolio fits into a one page website with additional pop up pages.</p>

			    <p class="modal-text">The chatbot was later added where the user can interact with me, the developer of the site, and ask questions by selecting the given options using the botUI plugin.</p>
			    <p class="modal-text">To create a continuous flow in the conversation, I created a flow chart in which the user always has a question to ask until the end of the conversation.</p>
